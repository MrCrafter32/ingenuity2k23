				    <h2>Open Meet</h2>
				    <p>the theme for ingenuity 2023 was revealed at the open meet which was conducted in november 2022. many easter eggs were left around campus prior to the theme reveal for students to find and guess what the theme was. </p>
				    <p>the previous theme, jekyll and hyde, depicted two sides of the same coin—one good and the other evil, and now the dimension is thriving another galaxy of the same universe. it is a place where all peace is procured and where it ends also. </p>
				    <p>performances from our artists in art clubs like kavishaala, impetus, and verismo equally graced the event. our fashion society, prism, curated their entire performance based on the theme, setting the stage on fire. the fest core was introduced, and they revealed the theme.</p>
				    <p>casimir: where left isn’t right and right isn’t left. </p>
				    <p>let the dark period begin.</p>

				    <h2>Freshers</h2>
				    <p>Whenever a new batch comes to the university the most important thing is not how the environment is or the studies, but when will the freshers happen. </p>
                    <p>This year our freshers’ were in the month of January! The event started with amazing food followed by tons of fun. People started clicking photos, enjoying the games, dancing or simply chatting. The various games the team had organised ranged from the likes of knocking over cans, to popping balloons, and even tinder treat, where people used pick up lines on each other.</p>
                    <p>This was followed by the distribution of titles to This way the event came to an end, with awesome and funny events, to energetic dance moves and gallery filled with photos and videos of the day no one will ever forget as freshers to "ek hi baar hota hai na" </p>

				    <h2>Prom</h2>
				    <p>Prom, an event filled with memories and a tint of magic. The occasion where not just couples or soulmates but friends and peers run away from the busy schedules, assignments, projects and classes to have a little bit of fun. This is what Prom is all about: music, food and a sip of crazy.</p>
                    <p>Every year celebrates a different theme, and this year’s theme was “Jab We Met.” Own your decisions, and always love yourself, no matter what, cause love will always find a way. Prom 2k23 comprised of games, food, music and whole lot of dancing. The night just kept going and so did NU. Everyone dressed up in partnership with a romantic delicacy.

				    <h2>Holi</h2>
				    <p>Life is all about colors. Colors can serve as metaphors for the emotions we express. The combination of the seven primary colors to create a RAINBOW draws us in even more. If the sight of a distant rainbows’ brilliant colors is enough to make us happy, imagine how much more so we'd be thrilled to actually feel them.</p>
                    <p>The festival of colors, HOLI, is always ahead of the curve when it comes to filling people's hearts with joy and love through the universal language of hues. Celebrations like these are truly unique because they unite communities and stir a wide range of feelings simultaneously. The beauty behind coloring each other lies in every touch of color on your skin.</p>
                    <p>The coming together of people is in itself a cause for celebration, and it need not be in conjunction with any particular event or location. Especially in this tech world, where virtual greetings are on the upper hand, festivals like Holi, Diwali, etc. teach us what is meaning of happiness in togetherness.The festival of Holi is celebrated in many different ways and has many different origin stories across India, but its underlying message is always the same: good ultimately triumphs over evil. Holi is a festival honoring the arrival of spring as well as love and new beginnings.</p>

				    <h2>Lohri</h2>
				    <p>“Gajak mungfali di mithaas zindagi mein<br>
Lohri ki aapko lakh lakh vadhaiyan!”</p>
                    <p>Lohri is a popular winter festival confined to the country’s northern parts. It is celebrated enthusiastically and traditionally on the 13th of January every year, marking the end of the winter solstice and the beginning of longer days. The celebration is incomplete without the traditional Bhangra and Gidda dance performances, which are accompanied by the beats of the dhol, a type of drum. </p>
                    <p>NIIT celebrated the festival by gathering around a bonfire, singing and shaking legs to traditional folk songs, and feasting on rewri, gajjak, and jaggery delicacies. The celebration started with the lighting of the bonfire in the evening. Usually, families gather around the fire and offer prayers to the deities for a good harvest, prosperity, and happiness. They also throw popcorn, sesame seeds, peanuts, and other offerings into the fire. The celebration started as the sun set and continued till 9. The glittery lights and starry night set a perfect environment to celebrate the festival.</p>

				    <h2>Show your Talent</h2>
				    <p>The saying goes, "Your greatest talent is so much more powerful than your greatest fear."</p>
                    <p>NIIT university is the one, which can provide plenty of such opportunities where you can showcase your talents. The genius of the plan is in its design, which sets aside specific time for new students to get to know the campus and their fellow classmates. </p>
                    <p>As a first step toward overcoming inhibitions and sharing your talents, "Show your Talent" is a powerful motivator. Students with young minds and developing talents, such as dancing, lyricists, poetry, instrumentalists, fashion walk, singing, acting, storytelling, photography, and mimicry, polish their skills in preparation for an evening performance in front of their co-NU family members. NIIT university is the epicenter for fostering the development of new talent.</p>

				    <h2>All Stars: Volleyball and Basketball</h2>
				    <p>Do you remember your childhood when you used to play a lot of outdoor games both in school as well as at home? What a great time it was? However, with the introduction of mobiles and computer, students today are too hooked to the screens that they do not spend enough time playing as they should ideally do. </p>
